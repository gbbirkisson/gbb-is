Oh hello there,

My name is Guðmundur Björn Birkisson. That name is a handful for most people, so I have a couple of nicknames. Most people call me Gummi. I grew up in the Westfjords of Iceland, but moved to Reykjavík when I was a teenager. I lived there for a while and finished my studies at the University of Iceland. Now I live in Norway.

"What is the point of this website?" you might ask.

Well, sometimes I stumble upon something very useful or interesting, and make a note of it. These notes have been scattered around through the years and can be a hassle to find. Thats why I decided to try to collect them to one place. Maybe you find the things I write down useful so feel free to [browse](../posts).

Thank you for looking at my website, and have a great day!

Gummi

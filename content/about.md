Oh hello there,

My name is Guðmundur, but most people call me Gummi. I grew up in the Westfjords of Iceland, studied in Reykjavík and now I live and work in Norway.

"So....what is the point of this website?" you might ask.

Well, sometimes I stumble upon something very useful or interesting, and make a note of it. These notes have been scattered around through the years and can be a hassle to find. Thats why I decided to try to collect them to one place. Maybe you find the things I write down useful so feel free to [browse](../posts).

Thank you for looking at my website, and have a great day!

Gummi
